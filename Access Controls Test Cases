Theory
Broken access control vulnerabilities exist when a user can access resources or perform actions that they are not supposed to be able to.

1. Admin URLs in robots.txt

2. Senstitive Functionality is concealed by giving it a less predective URL such as administrator-panel-yb556
The URL might be disclosed in JavaScript that constructs the user interface based on the user's role.
3. Parameter based access control methods
Some applications determine the user access rights or roles at login, and then store this information in a user controllable location. 
This could be 
->A hidden field, 
->A cookie, 
->A preset query string parameter
The application makes access control decisions based on the submitted value. For example
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true
https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1

This approach is insecure becauses user can modify the value and access functionlaity they are not authorized to.
